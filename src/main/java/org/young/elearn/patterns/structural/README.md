# Structural Patterns

how should **classes** behave and interact with each other?

If the pattern governs how classes within the logical unit interact with each other, it's a structural pattern.

For example, the MVC Paradigm, the logic unit includes 3 classes, the Model, the View and the Controller classes. The pattern governs how the M, the V and the C interact with each other.

If the interactions between the M, the V and the C were to change, the UI would not look or behave any different!
