# Behavioral Patterns

how should **objects of a class** behave and interact with each other?

If the pattern governs how the logical unit as a whole interacts with the outside world, it's a behavioual pattern.

For example, the Iterator Pattern, the logical unit includes just 1 class, the iterator class. This pattern governs how the iterator is used b the client (the outside world).
